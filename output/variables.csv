2,Biofuels Production - Ktoe,Thousand tonnes oil equivalent,"Notes: Consumption of fuel ethanol and biodiesel is included in oil consumption tables.

3,Carbon Dioxide Emissions,Million tonnes of carbon dioxide," Notes: The carbon emissions above reflect only those through consumption of oil, gas and coal for combustion related activities, and are based on  'Default CO2 Emissions Factors for Combustion' listed by the IPCC in its Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006).   This does not allow for any carbon that is sequestered, for other sources of carbon emissions, or for emissions of other greenhouse gases.   Our data is therefore not comparable to official national emissions data."
4,Coal - Prices,US dollars per tonne,Note:  CAPP = Central Appalachian; CIF = cost+insurance+freight (average prices); FOB = free on board.
5,Coal - Reserves - Anthracite and bituminous,Million tonnes,"Notes: Total proved reserves of coal- Generally taken to be those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The data series for total proved coal reserves does not necessarily  meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,  nor does it necessarily represent BP’s view of proved reserves by country.  Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio - If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate. Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratios are calculated excluding other solid fuels in reserves and production. Shares of total and R/P ratios are calculated using million tonnes figures."

The data series for total proved natural gas does not necessarily  meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,  nor does it necessarily represent BP’s view of proved reserves by country.  Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio - If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate. As far as possible, the data above represents standard cubic metres (measured at 15ºC and 1013 mbar) and has been standardized using a Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of 40 MJ/m3.
